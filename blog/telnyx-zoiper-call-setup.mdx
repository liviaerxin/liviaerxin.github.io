# 🌍 Using Telnyx + Zoiper for Canadian PSTN Calls Anywhere

I am developing a voice agent outside Canada. Without my Canadian SIM, staying connected via PSTN means I rely on **VoIP softphones** and **Telnyx SIP trunking**. In this guide, I’ll walk through how I set up two Canadian Telnyx numbers and used **Zoiper** on macOS and iOS to call between them—without needing PSTN compliance.

---

## ⚙️ 1. Telnyx Configuration

### 🔐 Credential-Based SIP Connections

I created two separate **credential-based SIP Connections** in the Telnyx console, each bound to a Canadian DID:

```json
{
  "sip_trunk_connections": [
    {
      "connection_name": "livekit-trunk",
      "connection_type": "credential",
      "domain": "sip.telnyx.com",
      "username": "userfrankchen9081",
      "password": "YJhY0pg0",
      "numbers": ["+12495304098"]
    },
    {
      "connection_name": "originmind-callee",
      "connection_type": "credential",
      "domain": "sip.telnyx.com",
      "username": "userfrankchen8081",
      "password": "YJhY0pg0",
      "numbers": ["+12495304046"]
    }
  ],
  "telnyx_test_center_number": "+18004377950"
}
```

<!--truncate-->


Each connection uses Credentials authentication which allows Zoiper to register and handle both inbound and outbound calls.
📘 Telnyx docs note this is ideal for softphones needing registration and dialing ([Quickstart guide]) (developers.telnyx.com, telnyx.com).

### 📞 Outbound Voice Profile

To enable outbound PSTN calls, I created an Outbound Voice Profile and attached it to each connection—allowing both Zoiper clients to place calls.

## 🖥️ 2. Zoiper Softphone Setup

macOS (Number A)
  • Configured using `sip.telnyx.com` and the credentials above.
  • Adjusted STUN and rport settings for stable connectivity.

iOS (Number B)
  • Similar config, but change the following if encountering connecting problems:
  • Disabling STUN
  • Toggling rport
  • Proper codec selection
  • Noted that background registration on mobile often fails unless these settings are correct.

---

## 🔁 3. Testing Call Flows

• Outbound Call Testing: I called `+1-800-437-7950` (Telnyx test center) to confirm outbound was functioning.
• Call Between Softphones: I made calls:
• macOS ➜ iOS
• iOS ➜ macOS
All calls connected successfully.

I used Telnyx’s SIP Call Flow debugging tool to inspect INVITEs, media negotiation, and responses—an invaluable resource for troubleshooting.

---

## 🌐 4. Hybrid Mode: FQDN + Credentials (Clarified)

⚠️ Important Correction: With a single SIP Connection set to FQDN + Credentials, inbound PSTN calls go exclusively to your FQDN endpoint, not to registered devices. Registered credentials only serve SIP-URI and outbound calls.
📘 Official docs confirm: FQDN handles inbound routing, credentials handle registration/outbound only (developers.telnyx.com, docs.livekit.io, support.telnyx.com).

---

## 💡 5. Lessons Learned

• Use credential-based trunks when testing with softphones.
• On iOS Zoiper, disable STUN and tweak rport for reliable registration.
• Leverage Telnyx debugging tools (SIP Call Flow, PCAP export) for diagnostics.
• Don’t expect DID calls to reach registered clients if the connection is FQDN+credentials only.
For that, stick to credentials-only or add your own proxy/forking logic.

## 🎯 6. Conclusion

With Telnyx + Zoiper, you can simulate two-way Canadian PSTN calling from anywhere in the world—even without a local SIM. Credential-based SIP trunks enable full bi-directional calling through Canadian DIDs. Adding hybrid FQDN setups is powerful, but only for directing DID calls to your infrastructure—not softphones.
