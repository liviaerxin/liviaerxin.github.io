# Orchestrating DAG-based task workflow in Celery

What's **workflow** in Celery?

In **Celery**, **workflow** is composed of multiple **tasks**, and a **task** is deemed to be a universal unit of the **workflow**, as a function in the program. In **Celery**, it's recommended to divide a long-running task into multiple short-running tasks. **workflow** comes out to help ease the orchestrations of the work, such as `chain()` three tasks.

## Construct a workflow

## Avoid running synchronous subtasks within a task

## Asynchronous tasks with a task

```py
@app.task(bind=True)
def update_page_info(self, url):
    # fetch_page -> parse_page -> store_page
    chain = fetch_page.s(url) | parse_page.s() | store_page_info.s(url)
    # chain()
    self.replace(chain)

@app.task()
def fetch_page(url):
    return myhttplib.get(url)

@app.task()
def parse_page(page):
    return myparser.parse_document(page)

@app.task(ignore_result=True)
def store_page_info(info, url):
    PageInfo.objects.create(url=url, info=info)
```

## Monitor the workflow
