# Designing Comment Threads for TikTok-Style Applications

In modern content platforms like TikTok, the comment thread is an essential interaction space. Users can post top-level comments and reply to others, forming shallow trees. While this might seem simple, designing this system to be efficient, scalable, and user-friendly takes some thoughtful architecture.

This post explores how comment threads are modeled, stored, and reconstructed â€” and then closes with a bonus section on using Redis for performance.

## Comment Thread Structure

Each video can have:
- Many **top-level comments**
- Optional **replies**, each pointing to a `parent_comment_id`

### Data Model (Relational Database)

```sql
CREATE TABLE comments (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  video_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  parent_comment_id BIGINT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  replies_n BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
);
```

## Reconstructing Comment Threads

To render a full comment thread:

### 1. Fetch Top-Level Comments

```sql
SELECT * FROM comments
WHERE video_id = :video_id AND parent_comment_id IS NULL
ORDER BY replies_n DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### 2. Fetch Replies for Those Comments

```sql
SELECT * FROM comments
WHERE parent_comment_id IN (:top_level_comment_ids);
```

### 3. Group Replies by Parent (In Memory)

```python
from collections import defaultdict

replies_by_parent = defaultdict(list)
for reply in replies:
    replies_by_parent[reply["parent_comment_id"]].append(reply)

thread = []
for comment in top_comments:
    comment["replies"] = replies_by_parent.get(comment["id"], [])
    thread.append(comment)
```

This reconstruction approach is efficient: **O(N + M)** time, where N = number of top-level comments, M = total replies.


## Scaling Considerations

To handle millions of comments:
- Paginate top-level comments (and load replies lazily)
- Use indexes on `video_id`, `parent_comment_id`
- Consider denormalizing data for hot content


## ðŸ”¥ Bonus: Redis Caching for Hot Threads

To offload frequent reads and keep response times sub-ms, cache the full reconstructed thread in Redis.

### Example Structure

```json
{
  "video_id": 123,
  "comments": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "content": "Nice vid!",
      "replies": [
        { "id": 4, "content": "Agree!" },
        { "id": 5, "content": "Same!" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Redis Key

```
comment_thread:video:123
```

### Recompute and Cache

```python
def recompute_comment_thread(video_id):
    top_comments = db.query(...)
    replies = db.query(...)
    ...
    redis.set(f"comment_thread:video:{video_id}", json.dumps(thread), ex=600)
```

You can trigger recompute on new comment events or via background jobs.

## Conclusion

Designing comment threads involves balancing simplicity, flexibility, and performance. Whether you're serving 100 users or 100 million, the pattern of parent-child comment structuring and smart reconstruction gives you a strong foundation.

And when performance matters most? Add a Redis layer to make it fly.
