# Set Up Samba Server in Docker

**!IMPORTANT**: Permission setting is very annoying but critical, sometimes you need take long time to fine tune it and debug.
**!IMPORTANT**: When setting up a Samba server in Docker in OSX, you will encounter problems such as `Operation not suppored` when using `bind mount`. Roughly saying, the reason is Docker run in a light VM in Mac and your Mac host uses a different file system(HFS+) compared to Linux(ext4 or similar). So switching to `volume mount` will solve this potential problem.

Some takeaways about Permission:

- Creating and deleting files is controlled by permissions on the directory.
- Modifying the file is controlled by permissions on the file. You may have a mask which is removing the write privilege from the file.

When I turned to set up Samba server locally, the main purpose is that I would like to integrate the Samba server into my Docker Compose project to mock a real remote Samba server, which will facilitate your local development in Docker environment.

So this blog will illustrate to set up a Samba server and a client, and test interaction between them.

## Start Samba Server in Docker

Here, we use Samba server image from [dperson/samba](https://hub.docker.com/r/dperson/samba). Although there is an alternative from [ghcr.io/servercontainers/samba](https://hub.docker.com/r/servercontainers/samba) or [crazymax/samba](https://github.com/crazy-max/docker-samba)

In OSX, it's critical to use `volume mount` and avoid using `bind mount` as we mentioned above.

:::note
In OSX, due to the docker desktop itself is running in VM, it will cause some error like `Operation not supported` when binding a local file folder via `bind mount` even you set `777` mask on the folder. So it's recommended to use `volume mount` to bind to `/mnt` in Samba server in OSX.

Furthermore, the Samba server will log such message: `error reading meta xattr: Not supported`.
:::

In Linux, it's okay to use either `volume mount` or `bind mount`.  

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
    --name samba \
    -p 139:139 -p 445:445 \
    -v mnt:/mnt:z \
    dperson/samba \
    -p -s "Mount;/mnt;yes;no;yes" -u "bob;bobspasswd" -g "log level = 5"
```

:::note
`-s "<Mount;/mnt>;yes;no;yes"` means [browsable:yes;readonly:no;guest:yes]", which will allow the guest to `read` and the user to `read/write`!
:::


Get the samba server IP address:

```sh
$ docker inspect \
    -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' \
    samba
172.17.0.2
```

## Start Samba Client in Docker

Use `dperson/samba` or `busybox` image,

```sh
docker run -it --rm --privileged dperson/samba bash
```

or

```sh
docker run -it --rm --privileged busybox sh
```

Inside the container:

```sh
mkdir /smb_share

# mount -t cifs //[server-ip]/[share-path] /[mount-point]
mount -t cifs //172.17.0.2/Mount /smb_share -o rw,username=bob,password=bobspasswd

# write file
echo "xxxx" > /smb_share/f.txt
```

## Start Samba Client which Create Volume in Docker

1. Create a CIFS/Samba Volume

```sh
docker volume create \
    --driver local \
    --opt type=cifs \
    --opt device=//172.17.0.2/Mount \
    --opt o=username=bob,password=bobspasswd \
    --name samba-volume
```

```sh
$ docker inspect samba-volume
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2023-08-13T16:24:03Z",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": null,
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/samba-volume/_data",
        "Name": "samba-volume",
        "Options": {
            "device": "//172.17.0.2/Mount",
            "o": "addr=username=bob,password=bobspasswd",
            "type": "cifs"
        },
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]
```

2. Start a container using the created volume `samba-volume`.

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
    -v samba-volume:/mnt \
    busybox \
    sh
```

## Use Case in Docker Compose

[](../code-snippets/docker-compose/samba/docker-compose.yml)

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import CodeSource from '!!raw-loader!../code-snippets/docker-compose/samba/docker-compose.yml';

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="docker-compose-samba.yml">{CodeSource}</CodeBlock>


## Troubleshooting

When you mount an Samba Share in Linux, you may encounter error like `failed: Invalid argument`,

```sh
bash-5.1# mount -t cifs //172.17.0.2/Mount /mnt/smb_share -o iocharset=utf8,rw,vers=1.0
mount: mounting //172.17.0.2/Mount on /mnt/smb_share failed: Invalid argument
```

You can use `dmesg` to debug,

```sh
bash-5.1# dmesg
[317258.750535] CIFS: Attempting to mount \\172.17.0.2\Mount
[317258.752956] CIFS: VFS: No username specified
[317336.240984] cifs: Unknown parameter 'passwd'
[317344.451345] CIFS: Attempting to mount \\172.17.0.2\Mount
```
