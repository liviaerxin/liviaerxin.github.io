# Generate self-signed SSL/TLS certificate for local IP address or local domain

In real life, when we build our website and make it public, some paid or free **Certificate Authority** (**CA**) will help us sign a certificate for our website **domain** (IP address is not acceptable!) and enable **SSL/TLS** connections from user browser to our server.

Given the secure reasons, the browser will only admit those servers's certificates signed from the authorized **CA**, and the **CA** certificate is kept in our host **system trust store**. In Linux, you can view the **CA** certificate file like `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`.

:::note
One of the most popular Certificate Authorities is [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), which is a free and non-profit CA.
:::

However, in many internal networks and development environments, we often need **self-signed certificate** more frequently.

Here is an example, we will generate a **local server certificate** that is signed by a **local CA**. Finally, let Chrome can visit our local website without security warning.

In brief, these steps we need to sign local sever certificate actually simulate how those CA sign certificates for public servers, as following:

1. Create a local **Root CA**.
2. Create a **CSR**(Certificate Signing Request) file for local server `127.0.0.1`.
3. The local **Root CA** use the local server `127.0.0.1` **CSR** to generate a **certificate**.
4. Install the local **Root CA** into our system(Windows, Ubuntu or macOS) trust store.
5. Run a simple **https** server to test local server **certificate**.

For those official CA, they have to validate the domain is owned by the server before the `step 3`, and we can ignore `step 4` as they are already installed into the system or the browser trust store.

And there is nice picture from [How to create your own self-signed root Certificate Authority(CA)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-create-your-own-self-signed-root-certificate-shankar-gomare/) to show the relationship between `CA`, `server` and `browser`.

## 1. Create a local CA

Generate a file `RootCA.key` and a file `RootCA.crt` of our local root **CA**:

```sh
openssl req -x509 -nodes -new -sha256 -days 1024 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout RootCA.key -out RootCA.crt -subj "/C=US/CN=Example-Root-CA"
```

You can change `Example-Root-CA` to others or add more fields to CA.

[Optional] Create a CA with a configuration file,

```sh
openssl req -x509 -nodes -new -keyout RootCA.key -out RootCA.crt -config <(cat <<EOF
[ req ]
default_bits       = 2048
default_md         = sha256
default_days       = 3650
prompt             = no
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name

[ req_distinguished_name ]
C  = US
ST = California
L  = San Francisco
O  = Example Corp
OU = IT Department
CN = www.example.com
emailAddress = admin@example.com
EOF
)
```

:::note
**process substitution** does not work in bash scripts!
:::


## 2. Create a signed certificate for the local server

Next, we should apply the local **CA** to sign a **certificate** for our local server using the server's **Certificate Signing Request** (**CSR**)
, which will be accessed through the `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` from our local machine.

### 2.1. Generate the server's CSR

When generating the **CSR** file with OpenSSL, we can either specify certain details directly in the command line or use a configuration file. While you can provide some information via command-line arguments, complex configurations like specifying `[v3_req]` and `[alt_names]` in belowing are typically done through a configuration file.

`subjectAltName` in `[v3_req]` will let you specify more than domain/IP addresses as **Subject Alternative Names** (**SANs**). And now modern browser require the server certificate to include **SANs**. Usage of the **Common Name** (**CN**) alone is not considered secure enough, and omitting **SANs** may result a certificate validation error!

Here is an example for using pure arguments to specify `-subj`:

```sh
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout privkey.pem -out csr.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=Example Corp/OU=IT Department/CN=www.example.com/emailAddress=admin@example.com"
```

Here is an example to use the configuration file as `-config`.

1. [Optional] Customize DNS by editing `/etc/hosts` (Other machines also have to do this if they would like to visit the server),

```conf title="/etc/hosts"
127.0.0.1   localhost
127.0.0.1   fake1.local
127.0.0.1   fake2.local
```

2. Create a configure file for **CSR** including typical sections as:

```conf title="localhost.conf"
[req]
default_bits  = 2048
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no

[req_distinguished_name]
countryName = XX
stateOrProvinceName = N/A
localityName = N/A
organizationName = Self-signed certificate
commonName = 127.0.0.1: Self-signed certificate

[v3_req]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
IP.1 = 127.0.0.1
DNS.1 = localhost
DNS.2 = fake1.local
DNS.3 = fake2.local
```

3. Generates the **CSR**

To generate a **CSR** using the configuration file with OpenSSL, you can use the following command:

```sh
openssl req -new -nodes -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.csr -config localhost.conf
```

[Optional] mix `-subj` and `-config`, to be short like:

```sh
SAN_LIST="[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost, DNS:*.localhost, IP:127.0.0.1"
openssl req -new -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.csr -subj "/C=US/ST=YourState/L=YourCity/O=Example CORP/CN=localhost.local" -reqexts SAN -config <(echo -e "$SAN_LIST")
```

Here, `localhost.conf` is the configuration file and the two outputs are: 
- `localhost.key` is the private key file for the local server to communicate with the clients securely.
- `localhost.csr` is the **CSR** file that the local server will use in the next step to sign its certificate from the local CA.


4. Verify the **CSR** file `localhost.csr`:

```sh
openssl req -text -noout -verify -in localhost.csr
```

### 2.2. Sign the CSR with the local CA

Now, it's time for **local CA** to sign a certificate for our local server by using the server's **CSR** `localhost.csr` file, thereby issuing a signed certificate.

- Generates `localhost.crt` by using CSR `localhost.csr`,

```sh
openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 1024 -in localhost.csr -CA RootCA.crt -CAkey RootCA.key -CAcreateserial -extensions v3_req -extfile localhost.conf -out localhost.crt
```

:::info
`-extensions v3_req -extfile localhost.conf`: `openssl x509` will contain `subjectAltName` extension in the certificate.
:::

:::warning
If `X509` extensions(`subjectAltName`) are missing from the certificate, the browser will still report security issues, such as **its security certificate does not specify Subject Alternative Names.**
:::

Or after **OpenSSL v3**, you can copy the extensions specified in the **CSR** to the certificate by `openssl x509` as this:

```sh
openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 1024 -in localhost.csr -CA RootCA.crt -CAkey RootCA.key -CAcreateserial -copy_extensions copyall -out localhost.crt
```

- View the generated `localhost.crt`:

```sh
openssl x509 -text -noout -in localhost.crt
```

- Verify the generated`localhost.crt`:

```sh
openssl verify -verbose -CAfile RootCA.crt localhost.crt
```

:::note
If the CA and Subject are the same one, the step of creating the local CA can be skipped.

```sh
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 730 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt -config localhost.conf
```
:::

## 3. Use the signed certificate in the local server

Run up a node https server to use the **signed certificate** for the local sever.

```sh
npx http-server -p 8082 --ssl --cert localhost.crt --key localhost.key
```

Then visit:

- https://127.0.0.1:8082/
- https://localhost:8082/

The browser will give you security warning as the local **root CA** is not trusted in default.

## 4. Install the local CA

TO trust the root **local CA**, we must install the **local CA** certificate `RootCA.crt` into each system **trust store** or each browser.

- Windows system trust store
- Ubuntu system trust store
- macOS system trust store

Then visit again, the browser will show green!

## [Optional] Sign the CSR with `openssl ca`

For complicated configuration for CA to sign a certificate, you can use `openssl ca` and the configuration file is like:

```sh
cd /path/to/your/ca/
mkdir -p newcerts
touch index.txt
echo 1000 > serial
```

```sh
cat <<EOF > /path/to/your/ca/openssl.cnf
[ ca ]
default_ca = CA_default

[ CA_default ]
dir               = /path/to/your/ca
database          = $dir/index.txt
new_certs_dir     = $dir/newcerts
certificate       = $dir/RootCA.crt
serial            = $dir/serial
private_key       = $dir/RootCA.key
default_days      = 365
default_md        = sha256
policy            = policy_any
x509_extensions   = usr_cert
copy_extensions   = copy

[ policy_any ]
countryName             = supplied
stateOrProvinceName     = supplied
organizationName        = supplied
organizationalUnitName  = optional
commonName              = supplied
emailAddress            = optional

[ usr_cert ]
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
nsCertType = client, email
nsComment = "OpenSSL Generated Certificate"
subjectKeyIdentifier=hash
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
EOF
```

```sh
openssl ca -config /path/to/your/ca/openssl.cnf -in localhost.csr -out localhost.crt -batch
```

## Troubleshooting

### Chrome **red** security warning

1. Go to `Developer Tools`.
2. Click `Security` tab.
3. Check `Security overview` issues.
