# Wiki Development Environment

Here are some experiences that I have gotten to prepare a best-practice development environment for projects. I would like to update to keep up with the latest tech stacks.

## VS Code

As of now, the `VS Code` is the most popular IDE among developers. Absolutely, for me, it's my first choice and favorite developing tool.

### Dev Container

What is Dev Container?

A "Dev Container" typically refers to a development environment that is containerized. Containers are lightweight, portable, and consistent environments that encapsulate an application and its dependencies. They provide a standardized way to package and run software across different environments, ensuring that the application behaves consistently regardless of where it is deployed.

The benefits of using Dev Containers include:

1. Consistency: Developers work in the same environment, reducing the chances of environment-related issues.
2. Isolation: Dev Containers are isolated from the host system, preventing conflicts with other software installed on the developer's machine.
3. Reproducibility: The development environment can be easily recreated by anyone using the container specifications.
4. Portability: Dev Containers can be easily shared, allowing developers to work on the same project with minimal setup.

Best ways to customize the environment in Dev containers?

- [Using Features](https://containers.dev/features)
- [Using lifecycle scripts](https://containers.dev/implementors/json_reference/#lifecycle-scripts)

How to Write Dockerfile for Dev containers?

You can refer to this repo [GitHub - devcontainers/images: Repository for pre-built dev container images published under mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers](https://github.com/devcontainers/images)

What magics does the `Dev Containers` extension do when starting?

1. Hook a default startup command `while sleep 1000; do :; done` to keep the container not exit. Disable this behavior by setting `overrideCommand: false`.

How to run a container inside of Dev containers?

- [Docker-in-Docker](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers/docker-in-docker)
- [Docker-from-Docker](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers/docker-from-docker)

For instance, I use the **Docker-in-Docker** method to always test/run Docker containers inside of Dev containers.
