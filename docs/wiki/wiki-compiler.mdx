# Overview

Let's have a look at the functions that a compiler should be able to build.

1. lexer(Lexical analysis)
   - generate tokens from source code
2. parser
   - construct abstract syntax tree(AST) from tokens
3. code generation
   - generate low-level code, such as assembly code or machine code

## Parser

`BNF` syntax is used to for computer to understand the expression, and is a critical concept to be followed to sequently parse the tokens to AST tree. Certainly, only one loop on the tokens is enough, which makes it very efficient.

`BNF` syntax for arithmetic operations grammar, including `+`, `-`, `*`, `\`, and `u-`(unary `-`) .

```sh
expression  :   term
            |   expression `+` expression
            |   expression `-` expression

term        :   factor
            |   term `*` term
            |   term `/` term

factor      :   NUMBER
            |   `(` expression `)`
            |   `u-`factor
            |   `u+`factor

```

`BNF` syntax for arithmetic operations and variable assignment.

```sh
expression  :   term
            |   expression `+` expression
            |   expression `-` expression

term        :   factor
            |   term `*` term
            |   term `/` term
            |   term `%` term

factor      :   NUMBER
            |   ID
            |   `(` expression `)`
            |   `u-`factor
            |   `u+`factor
            |   assignment

assignment  :   ID `=` expression
```

In addition, `BNF` can also be applied to define regular expressions:

```sh
expression      :   term
                |   term `|` term

term            :   factor
                |   term term

factor          :   atom
                |   atom `*`

atom            :   CHAR
                | `(` expression `)`

CHAR            : any valid character except meta characters (e.g., "*", "|", "(")
```

## Difference between Compiler and Interpreter

an **interpreter** also does `lexer` and `parser` jobs as a compiler does in step 1 and 2, but instead of generating low-level code, the **interpreter** generates the results directly.

## Bootstrap a compiler

A new programming language and a compiler written also in the new language is supposed to develop from an existing language. The progress is called **bootstrapping**, which can be summarized as,

```sh
C1  + L1  -> C20
C20 + L2u -> C21
C21 + L2  -> C22
C22 + L2  -> C23
C23 + L2  -> C24
```

`L1` : an existing language 
`C1` : an existing compiler for language `L1`
`C20`: a compiler written in language `L1` for language `L2u`
`C21`: a compiler written in language `L2u` for language `L2`
`L2u`: is subset of language `L2`

Bootstrapping stage:

1. Write a bootstrap compiler `C20` to understand language `L2u`(a subset of language `L2`) in using existed language `L1` and its corresponding compiler `C1`.
2. Use the compiler `C20` and language `L2u` to write the compiler `C21` to understand language `L2`.
3. Now `C21` is a fully self-hosted compiler, as well as its descendants `C22`, `C23`, and `C24`.

### Where did the existing compiler `C1` come from?

There is no need to use a compiler `C1` + `L1` if you write the bootstrap compiler `C20` in machine code. This solves the chicken-and-egg problem totally for programming languages.

1. Bootstrapping initial compiler `C20`:
   1. A small and simple compiler is created manually in machine code or written in `assembly` language.
   2. [Option*] Translate the `assembly` language into machine code manually if it's not written in machine code.
   3. The initial compiler is just capable enough to understand a subset of the target language `C` it is supposed to compile.
2. Use the initial compiler `C20` to compile the compiler `C21` written in language `C` while the `C21` is also supposed to compile language `C`.
3. Now compiler `C21` a fully self-compilation.

### Implementations

Interpreter:

- [GitHub - rswier/c4: C in four functions](https://github.com/rswier/c4)
- [GitHub - lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter: Write a simple interpreter of C. Inspired by c4 and largely based on it.](https://github.com/lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter)

Self-hosted Compiler:

- [GitHub - DoctorWkt/acwj: A Compiler Writing Journey](https://github.com/DoctorWkt/acwj)
- [GitHub - certik/bcompile: Bootstrapping a simple compiler from nothing](https://github.com/certik/bcompile)

The basic knowledge of `lexer` and `parser` is critical and necessary for developing a programming language, 
- `flex/lex`
- `yacc/parser`

### Compiler for a subset of C language bootstrapping from Python

Recently, I am becoming interested in building a `lexer`, `parser` and `code generator` to try to create a mini language and deep insight of how `GCC` or `Clang/LLVM` do their jobs.

For educational purposes, learning in practice is my favorite approach to grasp an overview.

Let's do it!

Prerequisites:

- Python for writing the bootstrap compiler 

I use [ply](https://ply.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/), a pure Python implementation of the `lex` and `yacc` tools to facilitate me to write the bootstrap compiler for the subset of C language.

Prerequisites:

- An existing `GCC` for writing the bootstrap compiler

Here are some popular tutorials from [GitHub - DoctorWkt/acwj: A Compiler Writing Journey](https://github.com/DoctorWkt/acwj).

You can also refer [GitHub - lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter](https://github.com/lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter) although I prefer classifying it as **interpreter** not a complete compiler.
