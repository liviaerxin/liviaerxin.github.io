Set up Coral Dev Board for employing an Edge TPU coprocessor.

Prototype new projects demanding fast on-device inference for the ML models.

## Resources

[Get started with the Dev Board | CoralCoralClose](https://coral.ai/docs/dev-board/get-started/)

## Background

The official documents [Get started with the Dev Board](https://coral.ai/docs/dev-board/get-started/) contains comprehensive how-to contents and rich examples. Here are just some experiences from myself. You can always go back to the official website to review and get the details.

The recommended method to access the Coral board is using [Mendel Development Tool (mdt)](https://coral.ai/docs/dev-board/mdt/), which is required to be installed on your host machine alongside the `Python`. Common steps to enter the shell terminal from `mdt` are in following:

1. `mdt` tool generate a pair of `SSH key`s, save the `private key` on the host and push the `public key` to the Coral using `http` via `41337` port.
2. Coral board has a running a `mdt-keymaster` server that is listening `41337` port, and put the `public key` into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
3. `mdt shell` now can login to the shell terminal of Coral board like `ssh mendel@192.168.100.2` when connecting over USB-C(OTG) or `ssh mendel@indigo-quill.local` over the same network where your host PC is.

:::info
Coral board is set up by disabling password login in `OpenSSH` in default, so it must be provided with `SSH key` otherwise you change the setting to be like `PasswordAuthentication yes`.
:::

:::note
You can check the `key master` by,

```sh
mendel@indigo-quill:~$ lsof -i:41337
COMMAND    PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
mdt-keyma 7846 mendel    5u  IPv4  20302      0t0  TCP 192.168.100.2:41337 (LISTEN)
mdt-keyma 7847 mendel    6u  IPv4  20619      0t0  TCP 192.168.101.2:41337 (LISTEN)
```

:::

Although `mdt` maybe facilitate the access to the Coral board, some magics and additional steps are kept from sight.

To do not use `mdt`, we need access the dev board through `serial console` instead of `mdt keymaster` server, to make configuration.

There are general ways to access a just-setup Coral in brief steps:

1. Connect to Coral board's `serial console` by the instructions [Connect to the Dev Board's serial console](https://coral.ai/docs/dev-board/serial-console/)
2. Log into the Dev board by username: `mendel` and password: `mendel` in default.
3. Enable SSH Password Authentication. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to change `PasswordAuthentication no` to `PasswordAuthentication yes`, and `sudo service ssh restart` to restart the ssh service.
4. Log into the shell using username: `mendel` and password: `mendel`.
5. If you want to keep the secure shell, generate `private SSH key` stored in host and `public SSH key` saved into Coral.
