# Learn CMake

In brief, **CMake** is all about **targets** and **properties**

<!--truncate-->

## CMake Project Structure

A typical **CMake** project can be regarded to has three `Tree`:

**Source Tree**:

```sh
project_root
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── simple_example.cpp
├── simple_lib.cpp
└── simple_lib.hpp
```

**Build Tree**:

```sh
project_root
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── simple_example.cpp
├── simple_lib.cpp
├── simple_lib.hpp
└── build
    └── CMakeCache.txt
```

**Install Tree**:

This tree is located in the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, of which default value is platform-dependent. By default, it is set to `/usr/local` on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) and `C:/Program Files/<Project Name>` on Windows..

To change it, you can pass `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` argument during CMake `configuration` step, like this:

```sh
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/custom/installation/path
```

Alternatively, you can change it by passing `--prefix`(it can be relative path) argument during CMake `install` step, like this:

```sh
cmake --install build --prefix "/my/custom/installation/path"
```

It's recommended to use a default install layout as `GNUInstallDirs`.

A **install tree** will look like as below if you'd like all things to be installed inside the project via `cmake --install build --prefix "./install`.

```sh
project_root
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── simple_example.cpp
├── simple_lib.cpp
├── simple_lib.hpp
├── build
│   └── CMakeCache.txt
└── install
    ├── bin
    │   └── executables
    ├── sbin
    │   └── sysadmin executables
    ├── lib
    │   ├── compiled libraries (*.so (unix) or *.dll (windows))
    │   └── library archive files (*.lib (windows))
    ├── libexec
    │   └── executables not directly invoked by user
    ├── include
    │   └── header files
    └── doc
       └── documentation
```

## How CMake Works

A typical workflow of CMake includes `Configure`, `Build` and `Install` steps, combined with the above mentioned `Trees` concepts.

1. `Configure` step will generate a sort of configuration files, the most important ones among them are `CMakeCache.txt`, `cmake_install.cmake` and `Makefile` if using `Make` as building system. With these generated configuration files, the later steps `Build` and `Install` will run according to them.
2. `Build` step will generate the build binary directory.
3. `Install` step will generate the install binary directory.

## How to make your package be found by others by `find_package()`

package configuration files: `find_package`

## CMake Variables

There are some useful and important CMake variables that will be introduced here:

`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`

`CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH`

## `clang` FAQ

### Find out `clang` include search path

```sh
❯ clang -x c -v -E /dev/null
...
#include "..." search starts here:
#include <...> search starts here:
 /opt/homebrew/Cellar/llvm/17.0.1/lib/clang/17/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX14.sdk/usr/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX14.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks (framework directory)
End of search list.
# 1 "/dev/null"
# 1 "<built-in>" 1
# 1 "<built-in>" 3
# 420 "<built-in>" 3
# 1 "<command line>" 1
# 1 "<built-in>" 2
# 1 "/dev/null" 2
```

### Add include search path to `clang`

Use environment variables `C_INCLUDE_PATH` for `c` and `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH` for `c++`.

`clang`:

```sh
❯ C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/homebrew/include clang -x c -v -E /dev/null
...
#include "..." search starts here:
#include <...> search starts here:
 /usr/local/include
 /opt/homebrew/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/lib/clang/15.0.0/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks (framework directory)
```

`clang++`:

```sh
❯ CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/homebrew/include clang -x c++ -v -E /dev/null
...
#include "..." search starts here:
#include <...> search starts here:
 /usr/local/include
 /opt/homebrew/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/c++/v1
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/lib/clang/15.0.0/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks (framework directory)
```

Use `-I` flag,

```sh
❯ clang -x c -I/opt/homebrew/include -v -E /dev/null
...
#include "..." search starts here:
#include <...> search starts here:
 /opt/homebrew/include
 /usr/local/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/lib/clang/15.0.0/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks (framework directory)
```

### Find out `clang` library search paths

```sh
❯ clang -Xlinker -v
...
Library search paths:
	/usr/local/lib
Framework search paths:
ld: Undefined symbols:
  _main, referenced from:
      <initial-undefines>
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

### Add library search path to `clang`

Use environment variables `LIBRARY_PATH`,

```sh
❯ LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib clang -Xlinker -v
...
Library search paths:
	.
	/usr/lib
	/usr/local/lib
Framework search paths:
ld: Undefined symbols:
  _main, referenced from:
      <initial-undefines>
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

Use `-L` flag:

```sh
❯ clang -L/opt/homebrew/lib -Xlinker -v
```

## What is the difference? clang++ | clang -std=c++11

## CMake FAQ

### Add library search path to `CMake` globally in project

1. `set(CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH ${CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH} /opt/local/lib)`
2. `LINK_DIRECTORIES(/opt/local/lib)`
