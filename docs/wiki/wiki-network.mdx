How does **Wireshark** sniff the network traffic on OSX?

On OSX, **Wireshark** use `/dev/bpf*` which is the OSX system's packet capture devices.
On Linux, **Wireshark** use `socket` to capture the network interface such as `eth0`.

## Proxy vs Reverse Proxy

Certainly! Let's explore the key differences between a **proxy** and a **reverse proxy**:

1. **Proxy (Forward Proxy)**:
  - Acts as an intermediary between **clients** (users or devices) and the **internet**.
  - **Forwards client requests** to the internet resource (e.g., a website).
  - Provides:
    - **client anonymity**
    - **caching**
    - traffic control
    - request/response transformation.
  - Commonly used for bypassing content filters and accessing restricted content.
  - Examples include:
    - **Squid**
    - **Proxy**
    - **Tor**
    - Charles Proxy
    - HTTP Toolkit
    - MITM Proxy
    - Fiddler Proxy

2. **Reverse Proxy**:
  - Sits in front of one or more **web servers**.
    - **Forwards server responses** to clients (users or devices).
    - Offers benefits like:
    - **server anonymity**
    - **load balancing**
    - DDoS protection
    - URL/content rewriting.
  - Used for improving server performance and enhancing security.
  - Examples include:
    - **Nginx**
    - **Traefik**

In summary, a proxy handles client traffic, while a reverse proxy shields servers by managing requests and responses.
