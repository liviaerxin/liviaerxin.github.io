# Wiki Assembly

Why `Assembly` language is important to to learn?

1. The most low-level language that is closely tied to the hardware such as `CPU`.
   - `Assembly` code implements a symbolic (human-readable) representation of the binary machine code.
   - `Assembly` language is written to follow the `CPU` execution logic directly.
2. `Assembly` language facilities a deeper understanding how `CPU` actually do its job.

Why `Assembly` language is critical elementary foundation to other higher-level language, E.g. `C`?

`Assembly` code is the important medium for compiling `C` code to machine code.
When `C` program being compiled to an binary object file, the `GCC` compiler will do following:

1. `C` code will be compiled into `Assembly` code
2. `Assembly` code will be translated into machine code

Is `Assembly` language cross-platform?

No, `Assembly` language is specific in the specific platform. E.g. `X86` CPU-architecture has its own `Assembly` instruction sets as well as the `arm` CPU.

`Assembly` is CPU-dependent as machine code is CPU-dependent, while `C` language is CPU-independent for cross-platform.

Is the first version of `GCC` written in `Assembly`?

No, `C` started with the `BCPL` language, [](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18125490/how-was-the-first-c-compiler-written)

A example **NASM** assembly file `print.asm` to print message

```nasm title="print.asm"
; print.asm
; nasm -f elf64 print.asm && ld print.o && ./a.out ; echo $?
; objdump -d a.out
section .data
message db, "Welcome,   to, Segmentation, Faults!, "

section .text

global _start

_printMessage:
    mov rax, 4       ; System call number for sys_write
    mov rbx, 1       ; File descriptor 1 is stdout
    mov rcx, message ; Pointer to the message string
    mov rdx, 32      ; Length of the message
    int 0x80         ; Call kernel

    ret ; Return from the function

_exit:
    mov rax, 1 ; System call number for sys_exit
    mov rbx, 0 ; Exit code 0
    int 0x80   ; Call kernel

_start:
    call _printMessage ; Call the print message function
    mov  rax, 1        ; System call number for sys_exit
    mov  rbx, 1        ; Exit code 0
    int  0x80          ; Call kernel
```

```nasm title="sum.asm"
; sum.asm
; nasm -f elf64 sum.asm && ld sum.o && ./a.out ; echo $?
; objdump -d a.out
section .text
global _start

; Function to calculate the sum of two integers
sum:
    mov rax, rdi   ; Move the first argument (a) to rax
    add rax, rsi   ; Add the second argument (b) to rax
    ret            ; Return with the result in rax

_start:
    ; Example usage of the sum function
    mov rdi, 5     ; First argument: a = 5
    mov rsi, 7     ; Second argument: b = 7

    call sum       ; Call the sum function

    ; The result is now in rax
    ; It can be used or printed, depending on the context
    mov rdi, rax   ; Exit code 0

    ; Exit the program
    mov rax, 60    ; System call number for sys_exit
    syscall        ; Make the system call
```

## Memory Layout

The structure of an assembly file generally consists of serval section:

- `.text` section:
    - `.text` section is generally read-only. It is typically used for storing executable code, and it is not intended to be modified during program execution.
    - `.text` section contains the machine code instructions that the processor will execute.
    - `.text` section contains global constant data.
- `.data` section:
    - `.data` section is writable. It is used for storing initialized data that can be modified during the execution of the program.
    - `.data` section contains global variable data.
- `.bss` section: 
    - It's mostly the same with `.data` section except it's used for storing uninitialized data 
- `.rodata` section:
    - It is used for read-only data, such as constant strings.

Here's a simple example illustrating the use of these sections:


```nasm
.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    // Code goes here

.section .data
my_data:
    .word 42   // Initialized data

.section .bss
my_uninitialized_data:
    .skip 4    // Uninitialized data, occupies 4 bytes

.section .rodata
my_string:
    .asciz "Hello, World!"  // Read-only data
```

A compiled program's memory layout consists of these segments.
A running program's memory layout consists of these segments, and also `heap` and `stack` memory.

## Memory Layout of a Running Program

A running program typically consists of serval segments or sections, each serving a specific purpose but common sections include:

- `Stack`:
    - Stores local variables and function call information.
    - Memory is automatically allocated and de-allocated as functions are called and return.
    - Register(`sp` in `arm64`, stack pointer) is used to manage and point to the stack memory.
    - Size is limited(may lead to **stack overflow**).
        - set via `ulimit -s` in linux.
- `Heap`:
    - Dynamic memory managed by programmer at runtime.
    - Memory is allocated and deallocated explicitly using functions like `malloc`/`free` in `C`, and `new`/`delete` in `C++`, `brk` system call in `assembly` etc.
    - Store dynamic data that can be shared across functions. Data lifecycle is not bound to functions.
    - Size is much larger than the stack,
- `Data`(`.data`, `.bss`):
    - Stores global variables/constants, separated into initialized and uninitialized
- `Text`(`.text`): 
    - Stores the code being executed

## Instruction

Assembly instructions are human readable representation of the machine code as CPU can only understand the machine code.

Instruction: Opcode + Oprand 


### Opcode

[Intel x86 Assembler Instruction Set Opcode Table](http://sparksandflames.com/files/x86InstructionChart.html)

### Oprand

Data area

#### Register Operand

Register Operand

```nasm
mov   rdi, rsi
```

#### Immediate Operand

Immediate Operand

```nasm
mov   rdi, 0x21
mov   rdi, 5
mov   edi, 0x21314151
```

In `aarch64`, the immediate value is subject to:

- Arithmetic instructions (`add{s}`, `sub{s}`, `cmp`, `cmn`) take a 12-bit unsigned immediate with an optional 12-bit left shift.
- Move instructions (`movz`, `movn`, `movk`) take a 16-bit immediate optionally shifted to any 16-bit-aligned position within the register.
- Address calculations (`adr`, `adrp`) take a 21-bit signed immediate, although there's no actual syntax to specify it directly - to do so you'd have to resort to assembler expression trickery to generate an appropriate "label".
- Logical instructions (`and{s}`, `orr`, `eor`, `tst`) take a "bitmask immediate".

#### Memory Operand

```nasm
mov   rdi, [sdi]
```

### Instruction Encoding

Assembler will encode the human-readable instruction into machine code.

- In `aarch64`, the encoding instruction is **fixed-size**(4 bytes) machine code.
- In `x86_64`, the encoding instruction is **non-fixed-size**(up to 16 bytes) machine code.

[Encoding Real x86 Instructions](http://www.c-jump.com/CIS77/CPU/x86/lecture.html)

Let's have a glimpse on the impact of the **fixed/non-fixed** encoding.

In order to load 32-bit integer, `x86_64` need only **one** instruction while more instructions are needed for `aarch64` to do that.

Load a 32-bit integer `0x1a2b3c4d` in `x86_64`,

```nasm
mov     rid, 0x1a2b3c4d
```

Load a 32-bit integer 32-bit `0x1a2b3c4d` in `aarch64`(the immediate value in `mov` must be in the range of `16-bit`, so it needs **two** instructions),

```nasm
movz    x1, 0x3c4d
movk    x1, 0x1a2b, lsl 16
```

## Assembly's Role in Compiler

In the compiling process, a compiler such as **GCC** will translate `C` code into `Assembly` code for different CPU architectures, then use its corresponding **Assembler** to translate the `Assembly` code to the machine code which is CPU dependent.

The `Assembly` plays intermediate role in the compiler, while higher language like `C` sits upfront and machine code runs at the bottom.

I have another writing to introduce my understanding of the compiler from the practice more than the theoretical point of view, and how to write a compiler.
