# Set Up NFS Sever in Docker

This document will introduce to set up a NFS server in Docker container and use another Docker container to act as a Client to test this NFS server.

> To set up a **NFS server** in your Host, you can check [NFS server installed and configured](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ubuntu-nfs-server).

## Start Up NFS Server

Use docker image [gists/nfs-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/gists/nfs-server) to start up a **NFS server** container.

In OSX, it's critical to use `volume mount` and avoid using `bind mount` as we mentioned above.

In Linux, it's okay to use either `volume mount` or `bind mount`.  

```sh
docker run --rm -d \
    --name nfs \
    --privileged \
    -p 2049:2049 \
    -v /tmp/volume:/nfs-share \
    -e NFS_DIR=/nfs-share \
    -e NFS_OPTION="rw,fsid=0,async,no_subtree_check,no_auth_nlm,insecure,no_root_squash" \
    gists/nfs-server
```

:::note
Before we use an old nfs server image [itsthenetwork/nfs-server-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/r/itsthenetwork/nfs-server-alpine/) which was not maintained more than 4 years and not supported natively in platform `linux/arm/v6`.

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
    --name nfs \
    --privileged \
    -v /tmp/volume:/nfs-share \
    -e SHARED_DIRECTORY=/nfs-share \
    -p 2049:2049 \
    itsthenetwork/nfs-server-alpine:latest
```

:::

:::note
In OSX, due to the docker desktop itself is running in VM, it will cause some error like `Operation not supported` when binding a local file folder via `bind mount` even you set `777` mask on the folder. So it's recommended to use `volume` to bind to `/mnt` in Samba server in OSX.

Furthermore, the Samba server will log such message: `error reading meta xattr: Not supported`.
:::

Get the ip address of the **NFS** server, which will be used later to connect the **NFS** server when mounting in a Docker container client. If you only want to mount the **NFS** server from the host, you can just know the ip address of your host.


```sh
docker inspect \
    -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' \
    nfs
```

Here the output is

```sh
172.17.0.2
```

## Use NFS Client in Docker

Let's make use of a Docker container to act in a NFS client to access shared data in the running-up NFS server.

:::note
run container as root by option `--privileged` or `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN` when permissions denied inside the container:
:::

```sh
docker run -it --rm --privileged busybox sh
```

Inside the container:

:::note
Due to the fsid=0 parameter set in the /etc/exports file, there's no need to specify the folder name when mounting from a client. For example, this works fine even though the folder being mounted and shared is /nfs-share:
:::

```sh
# In the container

mkdir /mnt
# nfs v4
mount -v -o vers=4,loud 172.17.0.2:/ /mnt

# create a file to test
echo "some text here" > /mnt/file1.txt
```

Then go to the Host to list directory `/data/volume/test`, where you will find the `file1.txt` is sitting.

```sh
# In the host
cat /data/volume/test/file1.txt
```

## Use NFS Client With Volume Mount in Docker

1. Create a NFS volume in Docker

```sh
docker volume create --driver local \
    --opt type=nfs \
    --opt o=addr=172.17.0.2,nfsvers=4 \
    --opt device=:/ \
    nfs-volume
```

```sh
docker inspect nfs-volume
```

2. Run the container with the created volume `nfs-volume`.

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
    --privileged \
    --name nfs-test \
    -v nfs-volume:/mnt \
    busybox \
    sh
```

Alternative, you can use the combined one command which will create a volume `nfsvolume`, 

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
    --privileged \
    --name nfs-test \
    --mount 'type=volume,source=nfsvolume,volume-driver=local,volume-opt=type=nfs,volume-opt=device=:/,"volume-opt=o=addr=172.17.0.2,rw,nfsvers=4,async",target=/mnt' \
    busybox \
    sh
```
