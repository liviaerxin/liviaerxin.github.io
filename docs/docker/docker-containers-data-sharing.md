# Share Data between Docker Containers

There are three types of data to manage data in Docker,

- bind mount
- volume mount
- tmpfs mount

![](../../attachments/images/types-of-mounts-volume.png)

Read [Manage data in Docker](https://docs.docker.com/storage/) for more information, it's a great official documentation!

Here, this page demonstrates some use cases in practices that you maybe face. As the official documentation says, **Volume** is alway the first choice and preferred mechanism for persisting and sharing data between containers, as one of the biggest advantages is that **volume** is thoroughly managed by Docker. That means:

- You can manage **volume** using Docker CLI commands ir the Docker API.
- **Volume** is easier to back up and migrate than **bind mounts**.
- **Volume** work the same interface in Linux and Windows, such as no need to worry about `POSIX` file path style in Windows.
- **Volume** driver features support you to store data on remote hosts or cloud storage easily.
- **Volume** on Docker Desktop have much higher performance than bind mount from Mac and Windows hosts.

Let's look at some use cases that leverage volume **driver** features

## Use a volume to bind a local folder

In default, the volume is created by Docker and its corresponding folder resides in Docker managed folder like `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`:

```sh
$ docker create volume xxx
```

```sh
$ docker volume inspect xxx
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2024-07-19T14:41:18+08:00",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": {},
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/xxx/_data",
        "Name": "xxx",
        "Options": {},
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]
```

However, sometimes you would like to bind the volume into a specified local folder(like `/data/volumes/testvol`) in hosts(only available in `Linux`)

```sh
$ docker volume create --opt type=none --opt o=bind --opt device=/data/volumes/testvol testvol
```

```sh
$ docker inspect testvol
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2024-07-13T04:36:16Z",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": {},
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/testvol/_data",
        "Name": "testvol",
        "Options": {
            "device": "/data/volumes/testvol",
            "o": "bind",
            "type": "none"
        },
        "Scope": "local"
    }
```

In Docker compose yaml,

```yml
services:
  frontend:
    image: node:lts
    volumes:
      - testvol:/home/node/app
volumes:
  db-data:
  testvol:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: none
      o: bind
      device: /data/volumes/testvol
```

## Use NFS volume

## Use Samba volume
