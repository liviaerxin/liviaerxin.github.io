# Resumable Upload

To implement a resumable file upload, it is necessary to contain three parts:

- Protocol: provide a mechanism for resumable file uploads
- Upload Server: receive an interrupted upload and store it in local machine or in cloud storage
- Upload Client: upload the file which may be interrupted
