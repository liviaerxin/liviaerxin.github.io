# FastAPI Best Practices

## Limit Only One Access to Endpoint at a Time

Limit only one access to an endpoint at a time with `asyncio.Lock` in `asyncio` in **FastAPI**.

```js reference
https://github.com/liviaerxin/hello-python/blob/main/fastapi_request_lock.py
```

> NOTE: The `asyncio.Lock` only take effect in the `asyncio` loop level, if using `unicorn` to run server in multiple processes, it can not lock the request! 

No limitation.

```js reference
https://github.com/liviaerxin/hello-python/blob/main/fastapi_request_nolock.py
```

Limit only one access to an endpoint at a time with `thread.Lock`

Limit only one access to an endpoint at a time with `process.Lock`

## Attach A Background Service Into the Application

Run a background service behind the FastAPI server:

- share the same `asyncio` main loop with the server
- the service start when the server starts and stop when the server stops
- it should be light-weight and non-CPU heavy workload
