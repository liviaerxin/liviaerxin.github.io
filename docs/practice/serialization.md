# Serialization

[Serialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization)

[The need for speed — Experimenting with message serialization](https://medium.com/@hugovs/the-need-for-speed-experimenting-with-message-serialization-93d7562b16e4)

[MessagePack, Json, Protobuf](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/issues/819#issuecomment-586125191)

In computing, `serialization` is the process of translating a data structure or object into a format that can be stored(for example, in a file or memory buffer) or transmitted(for example, over a computer network) and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer environment).
