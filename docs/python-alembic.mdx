# Database Migration Using Alembic in Python

Foam includes note templates!
This allows you to easily create notes that have similar structure without having to use copy/paste :)

Templates support the [VS Code's Snippet Syntax](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_snippet-syntax), which means you can:

- add variables to the newly created note
- add tabstop to automatically navigate to the key parts of the note, just like a form
Below you can see an example showing a todo list and a timestamp.
