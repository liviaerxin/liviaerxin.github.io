# Zero-Cost CI/CD with Git Hooks and Docker Compose

For small projects or self-hosted apps, using a full-fledged CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions or Jenkins can be overkill. What if you could have automated deployments **without any third-party service**, and all you need is **Git and SSH**?

In this post, weâ€™ll walk through setting up a lightweight, no-cost CI/CD pipeline using **Git hooks** and **Docker Compose**, with deployments triggered by a simple `git push` to your production server.

---

## Overview

Hereâ€™s the basic idea:

1. You push your code from your dev machine to both:
   - A central Git host (like GitHub/GitLab)
   - Your production server (a bare Git repo)
2. The production server runs a `post-receive` hook to:
   - Checkout the latest code
   - Rebuild and restart Docker containers

This method is great for solo developers or small teams who want simple, fast deployments without external dependencies.

---

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Prepare the Production Server

#### Install Git and Docker:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git docker docker-compose -y
```

#### Create a bare Git repository:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/repos/myapp.git
cd ~/repos/myapp.git
git init --bare
```

#### Set up SSH access:
From your dev machine, copy your SSH key to the production server:
```bash
ssh-copy-id user@yourserver
```

Test it:
```bash
ssh user@yourserver
```

---

### 2. Add the Production Server as a Remote on Your Dev Machine

In your project repo:
```bash
git remote add production ssh://user@yourserver/home/user/repos/myapp.git
```

Now you can push to the production server:
```bash
git push production main
```

---

### 3. Create a Post-Receive Hook on the Server

On the production server:
```bash
nano ~/repos/myapp.git/hooks/post-receive
```

Paste the following:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
APP_DIR=/var/www/myapp

# Checkout code
git --work-tree=$APP_DIR --git-dir=$(pwd) checkout -f

# Deploy with Docker
cd $APP_DIR || exit
docker compose down
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/repos/myapp.git/hooks/post-receive
```

---

## What Exactly Happens During `git push`

1. You run:
   ```bash
   git push production main
   ```

2. Your local Git client:
   - Connects to the production server over SSH.
   - Invokes `git-receive-pack` on the serverâ€™s bare Git repo.

3. Git negotiates what data is needed:
   - It sends new commits, trees, and blobs over SSH.

4. The serverâ€™s Git receives the data and updates the bare repo.

5. The `post-receive` hook is automatically triggered:
   - It checks out the new code to the app directory.
   - It runs `docker compose` to deploy the latest version.

6. Only once the hook script finishes does the `git push` complete on your dev machine.

This means your `git push` blocks and provides real-time feedback on deployment success or failure.

---

## How It Works

- When you run `git push production main`, Git connects to the server over **SSH**.
- Your dev Git sends commit data to the **bare repo** on the server.
- Git automatically runs the `post-receive` hook.
- The hook checks out the new code and runs Docker commands.

No daemon, no polling, no fancy tools. Just Git + SSH + Docker.

## FAQ

**Q: Does the push block until the deployment finishes?**
> Yes. The `git push` command will block until the `post-receive` hook finishes. That way, you get immediate feedback if the deployment fails.

**Q: Does Git use SSH to send data?**
> Absolutely. All Git data (commits, trees, blobs) is transferred securely over SSH when using `ssh://` remotes.

**Q: Can I still use GitHub/GitLab?**
> Yes! You can push to both:
```bash
git push origin main      # Push to GitHub
git push production main  # Deploy to server
```

---

## Final Thoughts

This setup gives you a super simple and secure way to deploy code with nothing more than Git and Docker. For many indie devs and internal tools, itâ€™s all you really need.

Want logging? Add `>> /var/log/deploy.log 2>&1` to the hook.
Want async? Run the hook script in the background with `&`.

Happy hacking! ðŸš€
